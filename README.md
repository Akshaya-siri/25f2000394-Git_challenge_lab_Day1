# Git Challenge Lab – Day 1  
**Roll Number:** 25F2000394

This repository contains my work for **Day-1 Git Challenge** at IITM SEP 2025 Workshop. <br>
It demonstrates Git basics: commits, branching, merge conflicts, and history visualization.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Repo Setup**  
   - Created folder `24F1002193` & initialized Git.  

2. **Created 5 Files**  
   - `file1.txt` → `file5.txt` with initial content.  

3. **Commits**  
   - Committed each file separately with descriptive messages.  

4. **Branching**  
   - Created `branch1` & `branch2`.  

5. **Branch Updates**  
   - `branch1` & `branch2` updated `file1.txt` (conflict introduced).  

6. **Merge & Conflict Resolution**  
   - Merged branches into `master`.  
   - Resolved merge conflict in `file1.txt`.  

7. **Git Log & Graph**  
   - Verified commit history using:  
     ```bash
     git log --oneline
     git log --graph --all --oneline
     ```
